gorkempacaci,"Prolog, and Constraint Programming especially are great to have in your toolbox. I’ve done research in the field for years, and my job in the industry today is writing Prolog. There are real issues with Prolog:
- no proper module nor package system in the modern sense. 
- in large code bases extra-logical constructs (like cuts) are unavoidable and turn Prolog code into an untenable mess. SWI prolog has single-sided unification guards which tackle this to a degree. 
- lack of static and strong types makes it harder to write robust code. At least some strong typing would have been nice. See Mercury as an example of this. 
All being said, Prolog is amazing, has a place in the future of programming, and gives you a level-up understanding of programming when you get how the types in every OO program is a Prolog program itself.",1721308307,40994552

TBL surely had an itch to scratch with regards to logical knowledge representation dating back even longer than the web [1]. But Prolog has broader applicability not only in logical&#x2F;knowledge graph querying, but also in solving all kinds of discrete combinatorical optimization problems. Or, as the Quantum Prolog site [2] puts it, &quot;planning, optimization, diagnostics, and complex configuration.&quot; The site demos logistics optimization (in-browser demo) and reports initial optimization (parallelization) of Inductive Logic Programming and other ML tasks for partially auto-generating Prolog code from existing solutions.<p>Edit: ... and on performance vs SWI Prolog, too<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ENQUIRE"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ENQUIRE</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quantumprolog.sgml.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quantumprolog.sgml.io</a>",1721306399,40994552

magnio,"&gt; It is well known in the computer graphics community that the arc length of cubic Bézier curves has no closed form and has to be computed numerically. Sadly, I’ve not yet seen a proof sketch for that, though.<p>A cubic Bezier curve B(t) is a cubic polynomial of t in [0, 1], parameterized by the four control points. Since it is continuously differentiable, its length is the integral from 0 to 1 of the square root of (1 + (B&#x27;)^2), a quartic. Such an integral is well known to be reducible to the elliptic integrals, which have no closed form.",1721265108,40991075
nvpr,"The linked article says:<p>&gt; The arc length of quadratic Bézier curves actually can be computed with a closed form expression.<p>While indeed true, the article doesn&#x27;t provide the closed form expression.

Then split the Bezier at a halfway guess (try t=0.5).  Again use the formula to evaluate the split quadratic.  Repeating this in a divide and conquer fashion, you narrow in on the t value very close to 26% (or N%) of the arc length.<p>2D vector graphics standards expect to dash cubic &amp; quadratic Bezier segments so some practical strategy to provide an arc length parameterization -- even if unavailable in closed form.",1721269078,40991075

ashton314,"We are absolutely swimming in little languages. Consider these languages:<p>- The language of regular expressions<p>- SQL queries<p>- In web frameworks, the language of routes<p>- etc.<p>Unfortunately we embed a lot of these languages as strings. This is problematic because the language usually sees just opaque strings—we can&#x27;t apply any of our lovely static analysis tools to these little embedded languages.<p>I&#x27;m doing some research in this area. We just got a paper published at ECOOP. The big idea is that, with a little bit of clever metaprogramming, we can help the type checker understand these little languages better and give us more helpful hints or execute more efficiently.

shanoaice,"There is little meaning for NVIDIA to open-source only the driver portion of their cards, since they heavily rely on proprietary firmware and userspace lib (most important!) to do the real job. Firmware is a relatively small issue - this is mostly same for AMD and Intel, since encapsulation reduces work done on driver side and open-sourcing firmware could allow people to do some really unanticipated modification which might heavily threaten even commercial card sale. Nonetheless at least for AMD they still keep a fair share of work done by driver compared to Nvidia. Userspace library is the worst problem, since they handle a lot of GPU control related functionality and graphics API, which is still kept closed-source.<p>The best thing we can hope is improvement on NVK and RedHat&#x27;s Nova Driver can put pressure on NVIDIA releasing their user space components.",1721302474,40988954
